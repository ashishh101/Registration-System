# Registration-System
With the help of java spring boot, I have created simple registration system where we can do a basic crud operation.
At first I have created a database name finalproject. In this system you can find the login page as the main page when you run the program. If you dont have an account in this system, you are required to create an account. After creating an account you you can finally login in this system. After the login success you can find a dashboard. In the left hand side of the dashboard, you can find the table. In that page I have created a table where you can view all the user details. At the table I have created a edit and delete button form which you can edit and delete the user details. At last you can logout from the system.
I have not worked in other pages and also the validation part is needed to be completed. 
This the the flow of the system.
